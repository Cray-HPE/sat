# Introduction

The Shasta Admin Toolkit (SAT) is a project to create a set of command-line
interfaces that cover gaps in the Shasta product which were identified by Cray
service and support staff. Various RESTful APIs currently exist in shasta, but
they return large amounts of data in a JSON format which is hard for admins and
service personnel to parse. We would like to provide CLIs that are more friendly
for human consumption.

This repository contains the python code implementing this CLI or set of CLIs.
