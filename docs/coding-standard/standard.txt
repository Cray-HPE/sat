Rule 0:
Keep the standard short.

Rule 1:
Use pycodestyle to catch styling errors with python code, and use the
pycodestyle.conf file at the root of this repository.

    eg. pycodestyle --config=./pycodestyle.conf myfile.py

pycodestyle can be installed with 'pip3 install pycodestyle'.

Rule 2:
80 chars per line if you can keep it pretty, 120 max.
