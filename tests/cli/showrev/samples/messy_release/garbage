This file contains a bunch of garbage and does not even appear to contain any
key-value pairs. This should hopefully not happen in the real world, as the
intent is for all the files in this directory to contain release information in
a common INI-style format.

However, we still want to test that the 'sat showrev' will handle it gracefully
when there is a file present that does not really conform to the expected
format, even when there are stray = characters in the file like this one.
